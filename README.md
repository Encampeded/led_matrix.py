# led_matrix.py
A simple Python library for interfacing with the Framework 16 LED Matrix

See example.py for basic usage, or snake.py for an actual program.
Alternatively, just look through led_matrix.py. I've commented most things that aren't immediately obvious.

Currently you can't set the brightness of individual LEDs, only the entire matrix. It's clearly possible based on the built in gradient pattern, I just don't know how to do it based on the given documentation...
