# led_matrix.py
A simple Python library for interfacing with the Framework 16 LED Matrix

See example.py for basic usage, or just look through led_matrix.py. I've commented most things that aren't immediately obvious.

Currently you can't set the brightness of individual LEDs, only the entire matrix. It's clearly possible based on the built in gradient pattern, I'm just not smart enough to figure out how.
